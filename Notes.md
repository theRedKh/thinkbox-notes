### Web Crypto API

#### 🔐 Key Concepts:
Concept	--- What It Means
- Plaintext --- The original note (e.g., “My password is 1234”)
- Ciphertext --- The encrypted version (e.g., “dfi8J29X78...” — unreadable without a key)
- Key	--- A secret used to encrypt/decrypt (you can generate it or derive from a passphrase)
- Web Crypto API --- A secure browser tool for doing encryption/decryption
- AES-GCM --- A modern encryption algorithm you can use securely in the browser
