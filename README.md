# Thinkbox Notes

ThinkBox Notes is a lightweight, browser-based note-taking app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It saves your notes directly on to your device using `local storage`, keeping your thoughts pricate, offline and always available - no sign-ups, no syncing, no cloud.

This project is part of a hands-on journey into DevSecOps and web app security, showing how even a simple tool can be built thoughtfully with **security and privacy** in mind.
