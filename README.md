# NoteHaven 🌱
#### _Previously Thinkbox Notes_
NoteHaven is a lightweight, browser-based note-taking app built with React, Node and Electron. It saves your notes directly onto your device using `file storage`, keeping your thoughts private, offline and always available - no sign-ups, no syncing, no cloud.

This project is part of a hands-on journey into DevSecOps and web app security, showing how even a simple tool can be built thoughtfully with **security and privacy** in mind.

## ⚡Features
 - Add and delete notes instantly
 - Persistent storage using `local storage` - transferring to `file storage`
 - Fully offline - works without internet
 - Simple, clean interface, customizable themes


## 🛡️Security-Focused Goals (In Progress)
 - Input sanitization
 - Default Encryption on all your stored notes
 - Optional password protection for sensitive notes
 - LOCAL AI-assisted content tagging for extra privacy (future feature)
 - User login and authentication (future feature, for cloud saving)

## 🎯 This project taught me:
 - JSON local storage
